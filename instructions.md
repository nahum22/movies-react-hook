### Refactoring `MovieList` Component with Custom Hooks

#### Objective:

Your task is to refactor the `MovieList` component in your React application using three custom hooks to improve code organization and reusability. This will help manage the application's complexity by separating concerns.

#### Requirements:

1. **Develop three custom hooks:**

   - `useFetchMovies`: Manages the fetching of movies from the API, including handling loading and error states.
   - `useMovieFilterSort`: Responsible for sorting and filtering the movie list.
   - `useFavorites`: Manages marking movies as favorites and maintaining the list of favorite movies.

2. **Integrate these hooks into the `MovieList` component:**
   - Replace the current logic in the `MovieList` component with calls to these hooks.
   - Ensure the component continues to function as before, with capabilities for filtering, sorting, and marking favorites effectively.

#### Deliverables:

- Updated `MovieList` component code utilizing the custom hooks.
- The component should load movies, allow filtering and sorting, and enable users to toggle their favorite movies.

#### Notes:

- Each hook should have a clear, distinct responsibility and manage its own state and side effects.
- Ensure proper handling of dependencies in your `useEffect` hooks to avoid unnecessary operations.
- Test the refactored component thoroughly to confirm that it maintains its functionality and performance.
